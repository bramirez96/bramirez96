### Hi! My name is Brandon, and I've been programming for 10 years 👴

I started at the age of 14, when I found a web design book in my school library. I quickly worked through its contents, and soon after taught myself CSS, Javascript, XML, PHP, and SQL online at W3Schools 💻. In high school, I started programming on my TI-84 graphing calculator, making escape room games 🚪, roguelikes 🤺, and even a (buggy) snake clone 🐍! Needless to say, I fell in love with programming at a young age, and my curiosity and passion for learning still drive me to this day 👨‍💻. More than anything, I love seeing how far web technology has progressed 🕰 since my inception as a programmer.

### Current Projects

Currently, I'm a web designer for [Story Squad 📃](https://github.com/story-squad), where I led a complete rebuild of our [Story Contest 🏅](https://contest.storysquad.app)'s frontend application in TypeScript, and am working on a [Deno 🦎](https://deno.land) rebuild of our existing web server to be used across all of our future applications. My team is a close-knit, talented group of full-stack devs 👩‍🔬👨‍💻. We're constantly growing and developing our programming skills together and it's been incredibly rewarding to get to know each and every one of them 👐

### Connect

I don't have a huge social media presence, but feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/bramirez96)! I'd love to hear if any of my projects interested you and I'm more than happy to answer any questions you have about them or the technologies used to build them!

(Bonus points if you ask me about Deno, I'm loving it!)
