# Welcome to my GitHub!

Hi! My name is Brandon, and I've been programming for 10 years! I started at the age of 14, when I found a web design book in my school library. I quickly worked through its contents, and soon after taught myself CSS, Javascript, XML, PHP, and SQL online at W3Schools. I n high school, I started programming on my TI-84, making escape room games, roguelikes, and even a (buggy) snake clone! Needless to say, I fell in love with programming at a young age, and my curiosity and passion for learning still drive me to this day.

These days, I'm primarily a web designer, and I love seeing how far web technology has progressed since my inception as a programmer. Here are some of my skills:

* React applications with Redux for state management (including thunk and saga patterns)
* Node/Express servers using PostgreSQL/Knex to persist data on a RESTful API
* OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation to clearly outline the behavior of a RESTful API
* Relational database schema design that is non-redundant with enforced referential integrity
* Python console-based applications with clean, user-friendly UIs

I don't have a huge social media presence, but feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/bramirez96)! I'd love to hear if any of my projects interested you and I'm more than happy to answer any questions you have about them or the technologies used to build them!
