### Hi! My name is Brandon, and I've been programming for 14 years 👴

I started at the age of 14, when I found a web design book in my school library. I quickly worked through its contents, and soon after taught myself CSS, Javascript, XML, PHP, and SQL online at W3Schools 💻. In high school, I started programming on my TI-84 graphing calculator, making escape room games 🚪, roguelikes 🤺, and even a (buggy) snake clone 🐍! Needless to say, I fell in love with programming at a young age, and my curiosity and passion for learning still drive me to this day 👨‍💻. More than anything, I love seeing how far web technology has progressed 🕰 since my inception as a programmer.

### Issio Solutions _(Nov 2021 - February 2024)_

I currently work at [Issio Solutions ⚕](https://www.issio.com), a kickass, mission-driven startup aimed at using technology to improve patient care and job satisfaction for nurses and other medical staff with cutting-edge data analytics 📊, workforce optimization 📈 tools, and automated float pool staffing 👩‍💼. Right now I'm learning the ropes, building internal tools to help our support staff respond more easily to client needs. As the project has been in development long before the indutry's widespread acceptance of modern frameworks (Typescript, React, Node/Express), the project is written with a PHP backend and a fully-compatible ES5/jQuery frontend.

It's been an interesting transition moving off of my bleeding-edge and often experimental Story Squad stacks and back into PHP (something I hadn't touched in ~4 years) but I've thoroughly enjoyed refreshing my old skills, as well as learning our product's fully-custom UI framework. Cherry on top 🍒? Using vanilla JavaScript again (and dealing with the headaches of prototypal inheritance and function binding) has brought me back to the basics and really solidified my grasp of ES6's under-the-hood syntactical sugar.

### Story Squad _(Oct 2020 - Oct 2021)_

Prior to my current role, I was the Product Engineering Manager at [Story Squad 📃](https://github.com/story-squad), where I led a complete rebuild of our [Story Contest 🏅](https://clash.storysquad.app)'s frontend application in React/Recoil and TypeScript, and a [Deno 🦎](https://deno.land) rebuild of our old web server to be used across all of our future applications. Later, as our needs grew, I had to convert our Deno server to Node.js, but the architectural patterns and strong typing made the framework transition fast and easy. I worked with a close-knit, talented group of full-stack devs 👩‍🔬👨‍💻. It was incredibly rewarding to get to know each and every one of them as we grew our programming skills together 👐

### Connect

I don't have a huge social media presence, but feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/bramirez96)! I'd love to hear if any of my projects interested you and I'm more than happy to answer any questions you have about them or the technologies used to build them!

(Bonus points if you ask me about Deno, I'm loving it!)
